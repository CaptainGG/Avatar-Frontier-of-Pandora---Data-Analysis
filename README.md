1. Project Overview
Game teams often need to understand how players move through key content:

Where do players stop playing?
How long does content take to complete?
Which player segments behave differently?

To enable this, I created an end‑to‑end analytics solution using SQL for data transformation and Power BI for visualization.
This resulted in a self‑serve dashboard for designers, PMs, and analysts to explore player progression in real time.
